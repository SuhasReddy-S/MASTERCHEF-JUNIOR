Firstly take a bowl and mix 500gm all purpose flour and add 1 tablespoon baking powder, 1/4th table spoon of baking soda, then add 5 to 6 crushed oreo biscuit's or you can take any cream biscuit and if you don't have cream biscuit's add 2 tablespoon's of coco powder, 150ml of  vegetable oil, 2 egg and finally 250ml of milk then mix everything well. Take your faviorite shaped Aluminium bowl. If you take a aluminium bowl it will absorb heat as per the cakes heating point so surely take aluminium bowl.My faviorite shape is circle so I would like to go for it if you don't have it in your home no worries you can book one at amazon or flipkart or you can even take any aluminium container that is deep and is medium sized. Then pour this mixture into that and bake it on 250 degrees for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes take a fork and poke the cake with the fork and then take the fork out, if the fork comes out neatly then your cake is baked. After the cake is baked pour a little bit of hershey's to decorate the cake or you can even write the name of the birthday boy/girl or you can even write on what occassion did you make the cake. That's it. It is a too simple recipe right, do try it. I love the taste and the smell of this chocolate cake it is so,yummy Flavorsome implying delicious, tasty, appetizing, scrumptious, yummy, juicy, succulent, heavenly, inviting, luscious, mouthwatering, palatable, saporous, savory so on and so fouth.
